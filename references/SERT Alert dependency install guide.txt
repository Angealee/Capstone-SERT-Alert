SERT Alert Notes/Packages/Dependencies installation:

First you need to have:
-Git
-Node (npm, npx)
	-check if you installed the node/npm properly by using; node -v and npm -v

Then installation of dependencies and tools:

-npm install expo
	:to install the expo CLI first. using npm

NOTE: In this case we will use expo. Usage of npx is a MUST.
Use 'npx' instead of 'npm'
example: Use 'npx expo install @react-native-image-picker/picker' instead of 'npm install @react-native-image-picker/picker'

-npx create-expo-app 'appname' (NOTE: Only use this when creating a new project)
	:using this command will create the expo app you desire.

-npx expo install expo-router react-native-safe-area-context react-native-screens expo-linking expo-constants expo-status-bar
	:using this command will install all the basic/initial dependencies needed.

Then all good to go. Except if your device doesnt have the other dependency installed.
Errors will pop up and will say what dependency is missing. Just simply download/install them using the command "npx expo install"

example: npx expo install @react-native-image-picker/picker

to run expo metro bundler;
npx expo start -c

Extension to use: (OPTIONAL)
-Prettier
-ES7 + React/Redux/React-Native snippets v4.4.3
